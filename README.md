# [Cutting Edge Release Demo](http://compileofcrap.com/Solitary/)

## Who can contribute?

Everyone can! (and I mean everyone)  
**You don’t have to contribute code**. Add a new asset, fix a typo, report a bug, add some documentation, do some re-design or add a translation. This project just like most open source projects are in need of all sorts of different contributions. Not just code.  

All you have to do to get started is read up on this documentation.
